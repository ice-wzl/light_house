# light_house
## Design
light_house is broken up into four general components
The python server called lighthouse, the go agent called galleon, the python client called merchant, and the sqlite database.
I am hoping to add more agents in the future with similar capabilities to the galleon agent.

## The Theme
The project has a nautical based theme for components. The theme for the agents is based on 15th-17th century ship classes.
````
Galleon: a sailing ship in use (especially by Spain) from the 15th through 17th centuries, originally as a warship,
later for trade. Galleons were mainly square-rigged and usually had three or more decks and masts.
