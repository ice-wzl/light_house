# light_house
- LightHouse is in Alpha release, if you encounter an issue or have a suggestion, open an issue ticket or create a PR!
## Design
light_house is broken up into four general components
The python server called lighthouse, the go agent called galleon, the python client called merchant, and the sqlite database.
I am hoping to add more agents in the future with similar capabilities to the galleon agent.

## The Theme
The project has a nautical based theme for components. The theme for the agents is based on 15th-17th century ship classes.
````
Galleon: a sailing ship in use (especially by Spain) from the 15th through 17th centuries, originally as a warship,
later for trade. Galleons were mainly square-rigged and usually had three or more decks and masts.
````
## Setup
````
git clone https://github.com/ice-wzl/light_house.git
````
### Gelleon Agent Setup
````
cd agent
````
- Change the inital callback frequency (5 minutes default). If that is acceptable, you can ignore this step. You can always reconfigure the callback frequency once the galleon agent checks in with the lighthouse server.
- Callback_freq -> minutes
- Jitter is a "max cap percentage". Jitter will be randomized each callback between 1% and the value you have set for jitter (i.e. 15%). What that means is for each callback the expected jitter will be between 1 and 15% of the overall callback time.
- SelfTerminate is a max failed checkins. An error occurs if the galleon agent cannot reach the lighthouse server. Say the internet is out, or the lighthouse server is not running, that will count as an error. If the galleon agent is set to callback every 1 minute, and SelfTerminate is 20, the galleon agent will die in 20 minutes if it has failed to checkin with lighthouse.
````
# search for this line in galleon.go
    var callbackTimer = CallbackInfo{Callback_freq: 1, Jitter: 15, SelfTerminate: 20}
````
- Edit the ip address/domain you want the agent to call back to
````
# search for this line in galleon.go
	serverUrl := "http://192.168.15.172:8000"
````
- build agent
````
go build
#OR specific arch 
GOARCH=<arch> GOOS=<linux> go build
````
## Lighhouse Setup
````
python3 -m venv venv
cd server
````
- Setup virtual env
````
source ../venv/bin/activaate
pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt 
pip3 install uvicorn
# run the server
uvicorn lighthouse:app --reload
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/opt/light_house/server']

````
- by default it will run the server on 127.0.0.1:8000
- to bind the server to another interface
````
uvicorn lighthouse:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000                                                               2 â†µ

## Merchant Client Setup
````
cd client
source ../venv/bin/activate 
python3 merchant.py -h
usage: merchant.py [-h] -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s SERVER

Client to connect to a server

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        The username to authenticate with
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        The password to authenticate with
  -s SERVER, --server SERVER
                        The listening post address
python3 merchant.py -u admin -p password -s 127.0.0.1:8000
````
- Above is the default username and password, I highly recommend you change that.
